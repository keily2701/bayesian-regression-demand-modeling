# Bayesian Regression for Demand Forecasting

## 🔍 Problem
Companies need to forecast demand under uncertainty to improve inventory and planning decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a Bayesian regression model to estimate demand behavior and quantify uncertainty.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Bayesian linear regression
- Prior selection
- Posterior inference
- Model comparison

## 🛠 Tools
- Python (PyMC / statsmodels)
- Data simulation
- Visualization

## 📈 Results
- Improved interpretability of uncertainty
- Robust estimates under small samples

## 💡 Business Insight
This approach allows decision-makers to:
- Understand risk ranges
- Make safer planning decisions
- Adapt forecasts as new data arrives
